                    <h2>Increase in Green house gases</h2>
                Global warming is a significant environmental issue that occurs when certain gases,<br> such as carbon dioxide, build up in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases act like a blanket,<br> trapping heat from the sun and causing the planet to warm up. This phenomenon is primarily <br>caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial<br> processes. As the Earth warms, it disrupts the delicate balance of our climate system,<br> leading to various consequences.

            <div class="dec"><h2>Extreame weather events</h2>
            <p>The rising temperatures associated with global warming have far-reaching effects.<br> Extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, including hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves.<br> These events can have devastating impacts on communities, agriculture, and ecosystems.<br> They can cause property damage, loss of lives, and disruptions to essential resources like <br>water and food supply.</div>

            <div class="dec"><h2>Melting ice caps and rising sea levels</h2>
            <p> One of the most visible consequences of global warming is the melting of ice caps<br> and rising sea levels. As temperatures rise, glaciers and ice sheets in polar regions and mountain ranges<br> start to melt, contributing to the rise in global sea levels. This poses a significant threat<br> to coastal communities, low-lying islands, and vulnerable ecosystems. It increases the risk of<br> coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion, endangering infrastructure,<br> habitats, and human settlements.</div>

            <div class="dec"><h2>Take actions to reduce greenhouse gases</h2>
            <p> It is crucial to take action. Transitioning to cleaner energy sources, such as renewable <br>energy like wind and solar power, can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, implementing<br> energy-efficient practices, promoting sustainable transportation, and adopting eco-friendly<br> technologies are essential steps. Individuals, communities, businesses,<br> and governments all have a role to play in mitigating global warming. By working together,<br> we can protect our planet, preserve biodiversity, and create a sustainable <br>future for generations to come.</div>
